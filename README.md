Learn more about the project
The MongoDB and Neo4j exercises consisted of creating, modifying, and operating a series of databases. MongoDB was used to filter and add information, while Neo4j has been useful to create connections between datasets and operate on these relationships.

In addition, an optional analytical and visual report has been created using Jupyter Notebooks. Specifically, we used: 1) the "Pymongo" library for the analysis and 2) the Mongo-Atlas chart web for the visualizations.

Process difficulties
We have been working with MongoDB and Neo4j for 2 weeks and, although it is relatively simple, it has required changing the way things are structured in the head. I think this has been the most challenging part of the project. In fact, the change from working on MongoDB and Neo4j servers to using the libraries in Jupyter Notebooks has been quite complicated. However, these things are what makes everyone strive and I have learned a lot.
